                applications with Elixir based Phoenix MVC Framework, LiveView, and Ecto. My contributions include
                developing efficient real-time dashboards for multiple IoT devices, automating invoicing services, and
                implementing live help support. I actively monitor system performance and collaborate in code
                reviews, bug fixing, and providing custom features for clients.

                I have played a crucial role in enhancing productivity and data processing for mechanical designers.
                Notably, I had worked to optimize the Flow Sheet Builder tool (utilized for creating mechanical process flow drawings
                in AutoCAD) by 60% reducing its running time through redesign, strategic code restructuring using C# and VBA. I excelled
                in software
                testing, debugging, and seamless integration with application-provided APIs, working proficiently with MSSQL
                and PostgreSQL databases. Additionally, I took pride in guiding and mentoring fellow
                teammates on technical aspects to ensure project success. My time at BJIT Ltd. was marked by valuable contributions
                and a dedication to innovative software solutions.

                and enhance productivity for modern CAD software. I achieve this by developing valuable tools and

                aim to streamline workflows and optimize the overall user experience with the CAD software. Through my
                technical expertise and dedication to delivering efficient solutions, I ensure that our clients can
                make the most of their CAD software, ultimately leading to enhanced productivity and a seamless user
